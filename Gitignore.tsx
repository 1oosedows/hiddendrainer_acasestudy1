🚀 Hidden Drainer: A Case Study
Introduction
Cyber threats are evolving at an alarming rate, and among the most concerning are drainer-based attacks—stealthy, sophisticated, and devastating to unsuspecting users. As digital wallets and blockchain transactions become more widespread, attackers are constantly developing new ways to siphon funds without detection.

Why is this important? Traditional security research often focuses on phishing or malware, but drainers operate differently. They leverage social engineering, code obfuscation, and execution tracing evasion to remain undetected. This study aims to bridge that knowledge gap by simulating attacks, analyzing execution patterns, and developing countermeasures.

Whether you're a security researcher, developer, or just passionate about cybersecurity, this case study provides practical insights into defending against this emerging attack vector.

🔍 Research Focus
This study explores the detection and prevention of malicious drainers through various forensic and monitoring techniques. Unlike conventional malware research, this project emphasizes: ✔ Behavioral Analysis
✔ Execution Tracking
✔ Sandboxing Techniques

By dissecting how drainers operate, this case study provides a layered defense approach to mitigate risks, making it a valuable resource for security professionals and organizations.
