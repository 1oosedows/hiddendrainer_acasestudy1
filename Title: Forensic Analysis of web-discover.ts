Title: Forensic Analysis of web-discovery-content-script.bundle.js
Abstract: This report details a comprehensive forensic examination of web-discovery-content-script.bundle.js. It highlights critical vulnerabilities, potential exploits, and security recommendations to mitigate risks.
 

1. Introduction

The web-discovery-content-script.bundle.js file was analyzed to uncover hidden behaviors, including transaction manipulation, private key leakage, and potential data exfiltration.


2. Methodology
•	Static Analysis: Decompilation and manual review of obfuscated JavaScript functions.
•	Dynamic Analysis: Execution tracing, memory monitoring, and exploit simulations.
•	Network Forensics: Identification of unauthorized network requests.
•	Intrusion Prevention System (IPS): Developed a real-time security enforcement mechanism.


3. Key Findings

3.1 Hidden Execution Paths
•	Obfuscated function calls (e.g., new Function("return this")) suggest sandbox evasion techniques.
•	Hidden runtime execution paths may allow delayed activation of malicious behavior.

3.2 Private Key Exposure Risks
•	The fromPrivateKey() function processes raw private keys.
•	Heap analysis showed private key data persisted beyond function execution.
•	Memory leaks could expose sensitive cryptographic material.

3.3 Transaction Hijacking
•	The signTransaction() function allows direct manipulation of blockchain transactions.
•	Exploit tests confirmed unauthorized redirection of funds.

3.4 Network Exfiltration Attempts
•	Network hooks (e.g., fetch(), WebSocket, sendBeacon()) suggest potential data exfiltration.
•	Stealthy network communication attempts detected during sandbox execution.

4. Mitigation Strategies
•	Restrict JavaScript execution in sensitive environments.
•	Enforce strict access controls on cryptographic operations.
•	Deploy real-time intrusion prevention (IPS) to block unauthorized network requests.

5. Conclusion
This research confirms that web-discovery-content-script.bundle.js contains significant security risks, including transaction manipulation and potential data exfiltration. Security teams should implement active monitoring and enforce strict execution policies to mitigate threats.
